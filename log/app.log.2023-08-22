It is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with smaller amounts of other elements. The sun's energy is produced through a process called nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms combine to form helium. This process releases a tremendous amount of heat and light, which is what makes life on Earth possible.", finish_reason: stop
